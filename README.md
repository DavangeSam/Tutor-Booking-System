# Tutor-Booking-System
Overview:

The Tutor Booking System is an Android application that allows students to find and book tutors based on subject requirements, availability, and preferences.
I have built it using Jetpack Compose for UI, MVVM for architecture, and Retrofit with GraphQL/REST API for fetching tutor data.

Users can:
* View a list of available tutors
* Filter based on subjects and availability
* Book a tutor for a session
* Receive notifications about upcoming sessions
